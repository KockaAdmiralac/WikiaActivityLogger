# WikiaActivityLogger
A simple tool built in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for logging activity of a [FANDOM](https://community.wikia.com) wiki through several transports (only supported transports were [Discord](https://discordapp.com), desktop notifications and [Slack](https://slack.com)).

**As of 27th June 2018, the tool no longer works on FANDOM** due to the way it fetches activity (polling the MediaWiki API). A new tool, [KockaLogger](https://github.com/KockaAdmiralac/KockaLogger), has been released on July 2nd which has severely optimized activity log fetching but, unfortunately, cannot be used by everyone like WikiaActivityLogger could. If you have been hosting WikiaActivityLogger prior to 27th June 2018, contact @KockaAdmiralac if you want to set your activity logs back up.

Archived documentation can be found [here](http://dev.wikia.com/wiki/WikiaActivityLogger).
